## Call a train ##
Just click on a locomotive to open its ui and press one of the three shortcuts to register the train. Now you can call this train with the same key combination to a rail near you. The actual schedule will not change.

When inside your called locomotive, you can open the schedule with the same key.

By default only three key sequences are configured, a fourth key can be set in the controls menu
